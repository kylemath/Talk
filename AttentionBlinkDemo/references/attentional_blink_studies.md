### Summary
This influential study reconsidered how temporal selection operates during the attentional blink phenomenon. The researchers analyzed six datasets from five different laboratories, applying and refining a methodology that examined not just percent-correct responses, but also the characteristics of errors when participants miss targets. By analyzing serial position error histograms, they investigated whether the attentional blink affects the latency (timing delay) and precision (variability) of temporal selection. The fundamental finding confirms that "two episodes of attentional selection cannot occur very close in time," providing important insights into the temporal dynamics of attention.

### Summary
This theoretical review article challenged the traditional view of the attentional blink as a universal cognitive limitation. The authors systematically reviewed research showing that AB task performance varies greatly between individuals, with some showing no AB in certain paradigms. The key finding is that individuals with higher levels of executive working memory functioning and broader attentional focus perform better in the AB paradigm than individuals with lower executive functioning and narrower attentional focus. The metaphorical title "seeing the bigger picture" reflects the finding that broader attentional focus correlates with better AB performance. This work has been highly influential in demonstrating that the AB is a multifaceted phenomenon arising from multiple contributing factors rather than a single bottleneck.

Contributions of the ventral striatum to conscious perception: An intracranial EEG study of the attentional blink. *Journal of Neuroscience, 37*(5), 1081-1089. https://doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2282-16.2016

### Summary
This groundbreaking study used rare intracranial EEG recordings from seven patients to examine whether the ventral striatum contributes to conscious perception during the attentional blink. The researchers found that conscious target perception was influenced by ventral striatal activity. Specifically, the failure to perceive the second target was foreshadowed by increased alpha and low beta oscillatory activity as early as 80 milliseconds after the first target. Additionally, only consciously perceived targets were associated with increased beta activity between 200-400 ms. These findings suggest that the attentional blink may result from very early T1-driven attentional capture and that ventral striatum activity contributes to conscious perception by gating cortical information flow, providing novel insights into the subcortical mechanisms of awareness.

### Summary
This influential study published in *Nature Communications* used magnetoencephalography (MEG) to investigate how the brain selects information from rapidly changing visual inputs during rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) tasks. The research revealed that temporal selection involves both continuous and discrete mechanisms occurring in sequence. First, all images undergo parallel processing. Around 150 ms, responses to multiple images are continuously amplified in ventral visual areas. Then around 350 ms, only reported images show all-or-none activations in visual and parietal areas. The findings demonstrate that multiple images can coexist in the brain undergoing parallel processing, but temporal selection eventually isolates a single image for amplification and conscious report. This work has been influential in showing that the attentional blink involves both gradual and threshold-based neural processes.

### Summary
This *Nature Communications* study employed novel multivariate encoding analyses to examine how neural activity represents visual features during the attentional blink. The researchers used randomly-oriented gratings and extracted feature-selective information from orientation-selective neural responses, providing better temporal resolution than traditional fMRI or standard EEG approaches. The key finding was that feature selectivity in neural responses is enhanced for correctly reported targets but suppressed when the same items are missed, whereas irrelevant distractors remain unaffected. These results suggest the attentional blink involves both short- and long-range neural interactions between competing visual representations vying for conscious access. The study overcame significant limitations of conventional neuroimaging by resolving neural activity associated with rapid serial visual presentation tasks (8-12 Hz).

### Summary
This study conducted three experiments to disentangle the roles of spatial attention, conscious perception, and working memory in causing the attentional blink. The key findings were: (1) spatial attention to the first target (T1) is neither necessary nor sufficient for eliciting an attentional blink; (2) conscious perception of T1 is necessary but not sufficient for the blink to occur; (3) when T1 was task-irrelevant, consciously perceiving it only triggered a blink when it matched the attentional set for the second target (T2); and (4) consciously perceiving a task-relevant event causes the blink, possibly by triggering encoding into working memory. This research has important implications for understanding the relationships between spatial attention, conscious perception, and working memory, as well as for distinguishing between access and phenomenal consciousness.

### Summary
This brief report extended the relational account of visual attention—which proposes that attention is tuned to relative feature values rather than specific feature values—to explain the attentional blink phenomenon. The researchers tested whether observers identifying an orange target letter that was either redder or yellower than other letters would show an AB not only to exact color matches, but also to distractors matching only the relative color of the target. The study found that both target-matching distractors and relatively matching distractors produced equally large attentional blinks, while unrelated distractors mostly failed to produce significant blinks. These results provide important support for extending the relational account from spatial attention to attentional engagement and temporal selection of objects.

### Summary
This comprehensive integrative review synthesized event-related potential (ERP) research to identify which cognitive processes are disrupted during the attentional blink—the impaired ability to report a second target when it appears in close succession after a first target. The review identified that AB failures primarily involve two disrupted processes: (1) attentional engagement (indicated by a smaller and delayed N2pc component), which occurs after early sensory processing remains intact (P1 component is preserved), and (2) working memory encoding (indicated by an absent P3b component). Importantly, the review notes that failure to encode the second target into working memory can occur independently, even when attentional engagement and semantic processing (N400 component) remain intact. The AB phenomenon thus emerges from disruption of both attentional engagement and working memory encoding processes, rather than from a single bottleneck, resolving a decades-long debate about whether the limitation is structural (memory capacity) or attentional in nature.
