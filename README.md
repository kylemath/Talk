# Talk Repository

🚀 **[Live Demo](https://kylemath.github.io/Talk)** 🚀

This repository contains materials for seminar presentation organization, including live demos and web-based examples.

## Purpose

This repo serves as a central hub for organizing and delivering interactive seminar presentations. It houses web-based demonstrations, presentation files, and supporting materials designed to accompany live teaching and research presentations.

## Contents

- **HTML Presentations**: Interactive web-based seminar presentations (e.g., `ai_research_teaching_seminar.html`)
- **Image Generation Prompts**: Documentation of prompts used for generating visual aids (`image_generation_prompts.txt`)
- **Generated Images**: Visual assets created for presentations (PNG files)

## Usage

### Running Presentations

Open the HTML files directly in a web browser to view interactive presentations with live demos and examples.

### Image Generation

The `image_generation_prompts.txt` file contains detailed prompts used to generate presentation visuals. These can be used with AI image generation tools to recreate or modify images as needed.
