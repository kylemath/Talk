IMAGE GENERATION PROMPTS FOR AI RESEARCH & TEACHING SEMINAR
================================================================

PROMPT 1: RESEARCH WORKFLOW DIAGRAM
=====================================

Create a whiteboard style infographic showing a flowchart diagram illustrating the AI-powered research workflow from ideation to publication. 

- A horizontal or circular flow showing 7 connected stages:
  1. IDEATION: Light bulb icon with question marks, representing initial curiosity
  2. LITERATURE REVIEW: Stack of papers/books with magnifying glass, AI assistant analyzing documents, citations flowing out
  3. INTERACTIVE DEMOS: Computer screen showing interactive web simulation with adjustable parameter sliders and real-time graphs
  4. EXPERIMENTS: AI running experiments on model responses, large online datasets, web-based games collecting single-subject data
  5. ANALYSIS: Code editor/scripts with statistical outputs, graphs being generated automatically
  6. AUTOMATED PIPELINE: Conveyor belt or pipeline showing data flowing through to generate figures, tables, methods sections automatically
  7. MANUSCRIPT & SUBMISSION: Finished paper with journal logo, collaborative revision arrows, final submission checkmark

- Each stage should have:
  * Clear icon or pictograph
  * Brief descriptive title 
  
- Visual elements to include:
  * Feedback loops from later stages back to earlier ones
  * Color coding: cool blues/purples for early stages, warm oranges/reds for later stages
  * Small detail elements: code snippets, data visualizations, collaborative icons
  
- Style: Whiteboard style infographic suitable for academic presentation
- Color palette: Professional blues, purples, with accent colors for emphasis
- Layout: Ensure clear readability from a distance in a presentation setting


PROMPT 2: TEACHING WORKFLOW DIAGRAM
=====================================

Create a whiteboard style infographic showing a flowchart diagram illustrating the AI-enhanced teaching workflow from resource collection to video lecture delivery.

- A horizontal or circular flow showing 7 connected stages:
  1. RESOURCE CURATION: Multiple sources (journals, books, OER) being gathered into organized folders
  2. TEXTBOOK GENERATION: Open textbook with text flowing onto pages, style guide icon nearby
  3. INTERACTIVE LINKS: Web of interconnected nodes showing embedded links to external resources and course sites
  4. CHAPTER ORGANIZATION: Table of contents, hierarchical outline structure, book divided into sections
  5. IMAGE GENERATION: Artist palette showing multiple visual styles (photorealistic, cartoon, whiteboard, medical diagrams)
  6. SLIDE CREATION: Text outline transforming into slide decks, same content shown in different visual styles side by side
  7. VIDEO LECTURES: Film strip with professor cameo, script pages, complete video lecture thumbnail

- Each stage should have:
  * Clear icon or pictograph
  * Brief descriptive title

- Visual elements to include:
  * Transformation arrows showing content evolving through stages
  * Style diversity: show same content rendered in multiple visual styles
  * Color coding: warm greens for early stages, vibrant oranges/yellows for later stages

- Style: Whiteboard style infographic suitable for academic presentation
- Color palette: Warm, inviting educational colors (greens, oranges, yellows)
- Layout: Ensure clear readability from a distance in a presentation setting


PROMPT 3: EVALUATION WORKFLOW DIAGRAM
=====================================

Create a whiteboard style infographic showing a flowchart diagram illustrating the AI-driven assessment system from question generation to automated regrading.

- A horizontal or circular flow showing 7 connected stages:
  1. QUESTION GENERATION: Tree structure showing textbook branching into diverse question types (short answer, essay, problem-solving)
  2. HANDWRITTEN COLLECTION: Classroom with projected questions, student writing on paper, stack of exam booklets
  3. OCR PROCESSING: Handwritten page transforming into digital text, student name/ID being identified automatically
  4. RUBRIC GENERATION: AI generating detailed grading criteria with itemized point values
  5. AUTOMATED GRADING: Student response plus rubric flowing into AI agent, itemized scores and feedback comments flowing out
  6. FEEDBACK DELIVERY: Results flowing to gradebook spreadsheet, emails being sent to students with detailed feedback
  7. REGRADING LOOP: Student concern triggering rescan and reconsideration, response being drafted with resolution

- Each stage should have:
  * Clear icon or pictograph
  * Brief descriptive title

- Visual elements to include:
  * Circular arrow from regrading back to earlier stages showing iterative improvement
  * Handwritten text samples and their digital equivalents
  * Color coding: cool blues for early stages, warm reds/oranges for grading and feedback stages

- Style: Whiteboard style infographic suitable for academic presentation
- Color palette: Professional blues, with warm accent colors for human interaction points
- Layout: Ensure clear readability from a distance in a presentation setting
